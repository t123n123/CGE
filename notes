the game engine
    needs game rules
    runs the game based on rules (maybe that's too much but it would be cool)


actions:
    - playing a card 
    - passing the turn 
    - attacking 
    - using specific card abilities (choose one, discover)  

actions can have requirements:
    - playing a card requires mana 
    - casting single target removal requires at least a target
    - attacking requires ability to attack

types of actions: 
    - instant   apply_function : (gamestate -> gamestate) 
    - targeted  filter : (target -> bool) apply_function : (target -> action) 
    - self-target apply_function : (gamestate -> card_instance -> gamestate)
